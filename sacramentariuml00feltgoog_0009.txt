vi PREFACE.

vice-Librarian, of whom Ι have spoken in the Introduction.
Ι am also under obligations to Sir Edward Maunde Thompson
for dating the MS. and to M. l'Abbe Duchesne for twice
answering my inquiries on smaller points

In the text itself, I have to some extent followed the pecu·
liarities of spelling of the MS. and have usually indicated at the
bottom of the page where another spelling has been adopted. A
certain number of the abbreviations to be found in the original
are also introduced: this was chiefly for brevity’s sake, nor can
any difficulty be caused thereby to any one likely to use the
book. I have not paid much attention to the stops employed
in the MS. But one kind is, Ι think, there to be found (via the
point) and that rarely and irregularly, and more frequently per·
haps for marking alternative readings than for the purpose of
punctuation. Where points are used by the scribe to mark
such readings, the fact is recorded in the footnotes. Ι have
myself introduced into the text only such stops as seemed
necessary to the sense. Ι t will be seen therefore that the present
edition does not offer an exact reproduction of the text, as it is
written in the MS. But, as the notes will show, Ι have corrected
some of the mistakes of former editions and have also been at
some pains to gather together information of various kinds,
which 1 trust will be of use for the illustration of the subject
